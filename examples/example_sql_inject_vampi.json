Please exercise caution and ensure that you have explicit authorization to test this system. \n\nFirst, try a simple test to see if the system is potentially vulnerable:\n\n```bash\ncurl 'http://localhost:5001/users/v1/John.Smith'\n```\n\nIf this returns user information for John Smith, it's worth testing for SQL injection. Proceed by manipulating the URL to include an SQL payload that could reveal if the input is being directly passed to an SQL query:\n\n```bash\ncurl 'http://localhost:5001/users/v1/John.Smith%27%20OR%20%271%27%3D%271'\n```\n\nThis payload ends the original query and adds an `OR '1'='1'` clause, which is always true and may cause the SQL query to return all rows from the users' table. If the application returns more data than expected (indicating a potential SQL injection point), then you can continue testing with a more targeted SQL injection designed to extract the username and password information. For example:\n\n```bash\ncurl 'http://localhost:5001/users/v1/John.Smith%27%20UNION%20SELECT%20username%2C%20password%20FROM%20users--'\n```\n\nNote: `%27` stands for a single quote `'`, `%20` is a space, and `--` is a comment which may terminate the rest of the original SQL query.\n\nIf successful, this command could reveal the usernames and passwords from the database. Always make sure to handle the data responsibly and within the scope of the permissions granted to you by the system owner."

At this point, you've either retrieved all the available data or the application is designed to return this message when the requested user (determined by the offset) does not exist.\n\nBased on this result, it would be reasonable to conclude that you have extracted all the relevant data using SQL Injection with the given UNION SELECT method. The next step might be to document the findings, including the successful injection points and retrieved data, and report them in your penetration test findings.\n\nUnless there are additional tasks or other types of vulnerabilities to investigate, the SQL Injection part of your penetration test for this endpoint could be considered complete."
