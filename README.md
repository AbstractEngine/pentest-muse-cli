# Pentest Muse

Building an AI agent that can automate parts of pentesting jobs. This application utilizes advanced algorithms and techniques to simulate penetration testing activities, aiming to streamline and enhance the efficiency of security testing processes.

## Disclaimer

This tool is intended for legal and ethical use only. It should only be used for authorized security testing and educational purposes. The developers assume no liability and are not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this program.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or later
- Necessary Python packages as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Setup

Before running the application, ensure that you have Python 3.12 or later installed on your system. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jhaochenz/Auto-Pentester.git
   cd pentestmuse
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up OpenAI API Key:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file like this:
     
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     ```
   - Make sure to replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.
   

## Running the Application

To start the application, run the following command from the root directory of the project:

```
python run_app.py
```

Follow the on-screen prompts to input your pentesting tasks.

## Example Demos

In this section, you can find practical demonstrations of how to use our tool to identify vulnerabilities of the [VamPI](https://github.com/erev0s/VAmPI) application running at `localhost:5001`. 

### Example 1: SQL Injection

This example demonstrates how our tool identifies a SQL injection attack on the VamPI application.

#### Task Input:
Run sql injection attack on the following URL and return all the usernames and passwords in the database:
`http://localhost:5001/users/v1/John.Smith`

#### Output:
